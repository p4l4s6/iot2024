# IoT-Based Monitoring System

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a robust IoT-based monitoring system utilizing Raspberry Pi Pico W, BMP sensors, machine learning, and MQTT communication. The system is designed to efficiently manage sensor nodes, collect environmental data, and provide real-time analytics and insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a scalable, responsive, and efficient IoT solution that can:

- Detect and monitor the status of sensors in a network of IoT nodes.
- Collect real-time data from sensors and analyze it using lightweight TinyML models.
- Provide actionable insights and alerts via a web-based dashboard.
- Support seamless communication between hardware nodes and a backend server.

### Backend

The backend is built using Django to ensure a robust architecture for managing devices and their data.

#### Key Features

- **Models**:
  - `Device/Node`: Represents each Raspberry Pi Pico node, identified by UUID.
  - `Sensor`: Linked to specific devices, stores metadata (type, status, model).
  - `Sensor Data`: Tracks sensor readings with timestamps.

- **API Development**:
  - Built using Django REST Framework (DRF) for authentication, status updates, and data retrieval.
  - APIs documented with Swagger for ease of testing and integration.

- **MQTT Communication**:
  - Facilitates real-time node management (e.g., identifying active nodes).
  - Handles sensor status checks and data requests via event-based messages.

- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with PostgreSQL for scalability.
  - Integrated Eclipse Mosquitto as the MQTT broker.

---

### Frontend

The frontend provides an interactive and responsive interface for system monitoring.

#### Key Features

- **Dashboard**:
  - Displays real-time statuses of nodes and sensors.
  - Alerts for offline nodes or malfunctioning sensors.
  - Visualizes sensor data using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Implements long polling for fetching updates from the backend.

---

### Hardware

Hardware implementation involves setting up Raspberry Pi Pico nodes with BMP sensors and on-device TinyML capabilities.

#### Key Features

- **Node Configuration**:
  - Sensor data collected over I2C interface.
  - Communication with the MQTT broker via Wi-Fi.

- **TinyML Integration**:
  - Embedded lightweight models for on-device analysis.
  - Nodes send processed data or predictions to the backend.

- **Testing**:
  - Verifies connectivity, sensor functionality, and MQTT message handling.

## Evaluation

The success of the system will be measured through:

1. **Functionality**: End-to-end testing of real-time communication, data handling, and system monitoring.
2. **Performance**: Assessing latency and efficiency in data processing and node response times.
3. **Scalability**: Capability to handle additional nodes and sensors without significant performance degradation.
4. **User Experience**: Ensuring the dashboard provides an intuitive and responsive interface for monitoring and analysis.

## Deliverables

- **Backend**:
  - Fully functional Django application with documented APIs.
  - Integrated MQTT communication.

- **Frontend**:
  - Interactive dashboard with real-time updates.
  - Data visualization and alerting mechanisms.

- **Hardware**:
  - Configured Raspberry Pi Pico nodes with functional firmware.
  - Embedded TinyML for edge analytics.

---

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced data analytics and visualization tools in the dashboard.
- Add support for additional sensor types to expand functionality.
- Explore edge computing enhancements to optimize processing.
- Develop mobile applications for on-the-go monitoring.
